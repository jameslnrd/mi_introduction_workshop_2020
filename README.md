Introduction do mass-interaction sound synthesis, using the FAUST web editor to run examples in the browser.

The ".mdl" codes are MIMS Mass Interaction Model Scripts that can be compiled into Faust or gen~ DSP code with the MIMS tool.
A web version of MIMS is available here: http://mi-creative.eu/tool_MIMS-Online_V2.html


The ".dsp" codes are FAUST dsp files that can be launched and experimented with in the Faust IDE (https://faustide.grame.fr/) or using a local Faust installation.

As with any FAUST dsp, it is possible to compile the code for a variety of targets (VST, Max/PD, Unity, embedded platforms, etc...).
